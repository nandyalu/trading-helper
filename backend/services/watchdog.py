"""Intraday alert watchdog and event-driven analysis triggers — all
rule-based, no LLM involved. ``scan_for_alerts`` does one pass over every
ticker on the watchlist — which covers every holding, because the agent may
not untrack a position it still owns —
alerting on big daily moves, unusual volume, stop-level breaches, and
price-target touches; big moves and volume spikes also nominate the ticker
for an immediate TradingAgents run. ``earnings_tickers_to_analyze`` feeds the
separate pre-market earnings task.

Sent alerts are recorded in the ``alert`` table keyed by ``dedupe_key`` so a
15-minute loop never repeats itself (per ticker per day for moves/volume/
stops, once ever per signal for targets). Everything here is blocking
(yfinance + DB) — call via asyncio.to_thread.
