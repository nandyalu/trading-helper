"""What the agent pays to have something analysed.

Research is free to the agent today. It is handed a watchlist and analyses all
of it, so "what is worth looking at" is not a decision it makes and not a
decision anyone can grade. Charging for it changes that, and it also makes the
question this app exists to answer honest: whether the model earns its keep
should include the cost of running the model.

**Off by default.** The price is a setting and zero means no charge, so the
live deployment behaves exactly as it did. The experiment deployment turns it
on. That matters while a model comparison is running next door: a research
charge would change the agent's cash, and two variables moving at once make
neither result clean.

The price is deliberately not the measured cost. At one round an analysis is
about $0.05 on a paid vendor and $0.003 in local electricity — a factor of
seventeen — so a single price is **a choice about scarcity**, not a
passthrough. $0.05 charges roughly what the vendor path costs.
