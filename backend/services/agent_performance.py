"""Is the agent worth running?

The agent picks stocks with an LLM. That only earns its keep if it beats the
two things it could trivially be replaced by:

- **SPY buy-and-hold** — did picking anything beat picking nothing?
- **A mechanical follower** — a rule with no model in it that buys every Buy
  signal in equal weight and sells on a Sell signal or when the signal matures.
  If the agent cannot beat this, the model is adding cost and noise, and you
  should run the rule instead.

The second is the decisive one, and it is why this module exists. Everything it
needs is already stored — the signals carry the price they were made at, the
price they were graded at, and the SPY prices over the same window — so both
baselines are computed from history rather than simulated forward. They start
the day the agent placed its first order, because comparing a strategy that ran
for a week against one that ran for a year says nothing.

Everything here is blocking (DB + prices) — call via asyncio.to_thread.
