"""Which tickers still trade, and which have stopped.

A delisted symbol does not fail cleanly. yfinance keeps answering for the
shell: AILEQ, delisted, returned five bars across two months, every one of them
priced at $0.000001. Nothing in that looks like an error — to a read-through
cache it looks like a ticker that is merely behind, so it refetches every half
hour forever, and the daily sweep spends minutes of GPU analyzing something
that has no market.

The rule here is deliberately about *freshness*, not price. A live ticker
produces a bar every session; one that has not produced a bar in a week is not
trading. That catches delistings, long halts, and mistyped symbols without
hardcoding a list or guessing from price — a real penny stock at $0.0001 is
still a real penny stock, and would be wrongly excluded by a price threshold.

Everything here is DB-only and cheap; it is checked on the hot path of every
market-data fetch.
