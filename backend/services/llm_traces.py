"""Every LLM call of an analysis, written to disk so it can train a model later.

Five small models have been rejected here for inventing prices, and the fix
that would rescue one is a fine-tune on runs that went right (see
[docs/model-training.md](../../docs/model-training.md)). That needs a dataset,
and **a dataset of past runs cannot be collected afterwards.** The analyses run
either way, so the marginal cost of keeping them is disk.

What one line of a trace file holds is one LLM call: the messages that went in,
including the tool definitions the model was offered, and what came back,
including any tool calls it made. About 21 lines make one analysis.

Three decisions worth knowing about.

**Nothing here may break a run.** Every write is wrapped, and a failure is
logged once and dropped. The same rule as ``llm_usage``: losing the telemetry
for a run must never lose the run.

**Traces are keyed by a run id, not a signal id.** The signal does not exist
until the analysis finishes, so the id is generated first, written into the
file name, and stored on the ``Signal`` afterwards. ``Signal.trace_id`` is what
turns a pile of traces into a training set: it lets a later filter keep only
the runs the Scorecard eventually graded correct, which is the advantage this
app has over any public dataset.

**Off unless a directory is set.** ``LLM_TRACE_DIR`` enables it. A deployment
that does not want the disk cost pays nothing, and no default path quietly
fills a volume.
