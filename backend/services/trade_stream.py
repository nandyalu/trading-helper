"""Live trade events from the simulated account, over gRPC.

Resting exits are the reason this exists. A stop or a take-profit can fill at
any moment, and nobody is waiting for that fill — so it was only noticed when
the watchdog next polled, up to fifteen minutes later. A stream tells us within
a second.

**Events are a trigger, not a data source.** Every event does the same thing:
re-run the settle path that already reads order details from the REST API and
is already verified against a real fill. Parsing the event payload instead
would put the fill price and quantity on a code path that has never been seen
in production — and the last time this app trusted an unverified payload shape,
the combo wrapper meant every fill stayed pending forever.

The 15-minute poll stays exactly as it was. A stream that silently stops is
worse than no stream, so this is a latency improvement layered over a
correctness guarantee, never a replacement for it.

The subscription is blocking, so it runs on its own daemon thread; callbacks
arrive on that thread and must not touch the event loop directly.
