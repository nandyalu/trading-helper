"""What one analysis cost, in dollars.

The telemetry has stored tokens and seconds since it was added, for one
decision: keep self-hosting or move to a vendor. Tokens do not answer that on
their own — somebody has to price them — and doing that by hand went wrong
twice in a week, both times by using a blended rate.

**Input and output are priced separately here, always.** List is $0.30 per 1M
input against $2.50 per 1M output on Flash-Lite, an 8x gap, so a single blended
rate is a property of the workload's output ratio rather than of the model. A
rate derived from a Flash-Lite sweep at 8.5% completion and applied to gemma4's
history at 16% understated it by 39%.

A self-hosted model has no vendor bill, and reporting $0.00 for it would be the
wrong kind of true — it reads as free when it is really paid for in GPU time.
So a local run is priced from the energy it actually used, and ``basis`` says
which of the two a figure is. The point is to put both on one axis: an analysis
that costs 5.6 cents at a vendor and 0.3 cents in electricity is the whole
self-host-versus-cloud argument in two numbers.

Prices are list, current as of 2026-08-25, and are **estimates**. Two billed
readings so far came in at 78% and 103% of list, which is why nothing here
claims to be the invoice. See CLAUDE.md for both measurements.
