"""What one analysis cost: tokens in, tokens out, and wall-clock time.

A self-hosted model's cost is time on a GPU you already own; a cloud
provider's is tokens on an invoice. Neither number converts into the other, so
deciding between them needs both recorded per run. The counts come from the
provider's own accounting (every OpenAI-compatible endpoint returns a ``usage``
block, ollama included) rather than from an estimate — a tokenizer guess would
be wrong by exactly the amount that matters when it is multiplied by a price
per million.

``llm_calls`` is recorded alongside the totals because a run that reports zero
tokens over twenty calls means the endpoint stopped reporting usage, while zero
tokens over zero calls means the run died early. Without the call count those
are the same row.
