"""Order execution against Webull's simulated (sandbox) account.

This is the only module in the app that places orders, and it refuses to do
anything unless ``quotes.is_sandbox()`` is true. That check is not a
convenience — it is the guarantee. Production credentials and sandbox
credentials are different key pairs pointing at different hosts
(api.webull.com vs api.sandbox.webull.com), so with the sandbox flag off there
is no simulated account to reach and every order would land on real money.

Two further belts, because one flag is one typo away from being wrong:

- The target account is resolved by ``account_class == INDIVIDUAL_CASH``, never
  hardcoded, and the resolver rejects any account whose number doesn't look
  like a simulated one (``DEM…``). A production individual-cash account is
  numbered 5NW31603; every sandbox account is DEM-prefixed.
- Every order goes through ``_assert_sandbox()`` immediately before the call,
  not merely at module import, so flipping the environment mid-process cannot
  leave a live client armed.

Field names come from the Place Order reference (developer.webull.com,
common-order-place), not from the SDK — the SDK passes dicts straight through
and validates nothing.
