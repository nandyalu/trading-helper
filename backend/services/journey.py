"""The agent's story, assembled from what it did.

The dashboard shows a snapshot: what is held now, what was decided today, what
the equity is. That is data. A month of it is still data, and nobody can read
it — because the interesting thing about an experiment is not its state but
its *arc*: what it tried, what that cost, what it learned, and where it turned.

So this reads the same tables the dashboard does and writes them out in order,
day by day, in the agent's own words. Nothing here is a second source of
truth: every sentence is derived from a trade, a charge, a decision pass or a
graded signal that already exists, so the story cannot drift from the book.

**What this cannot write is the half that matters most.** It knows the agent
changed its mind; it does not know that *we* changed the prompt the week
before, or that a research charge was introduced, or that the round count was
settled by an experiment. That interpretation belongs to a person, in
JOURNEY.md. This produces the chronicle; a human writes the history.

Milestones are detected rather than declared. A first trade, a first close, a
new high, a drawdown past a threshold — those are facts about the series, and
naming them is what turns a list of days into a shape.
