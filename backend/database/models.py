    ``message_id`` is the Discord message the analysis embed was posted as —
    reacting ✅ to that message executes the signal as a paper trade.
    Benchmark fields are filled at evaluation time alongside ``outcome``;
    they stay NULL on rows resolved before the columns existed or when the
    SPY window couldn't be fetched.

    ``horizon`` records which trade horizon the run used ("swing" or
    "position", see backend/services/signals.py HORIZONS). It decides how long
    to wait before grading and how wide the Hold band is, so a scorecard that
    mixed horizons would be comparing two different questions. NULL means a row
    predating the column.

    ``model`` records the LLM that produced the signal, so one model's track
    record can be read apart from another's — the only way trying a new model
    answers anything. NULL means a row predating the column, which in practice
    means gemma4-e2b-96k.

    ``duration_seconds`` through ``llm_calls`` are what the run cost. A
    self-hosted model is billed in GPU time and a cloud one in tokens, so
    choosing between them needs both, per run, from the provider's own
    accounting — see backend/services/llm_usage.py. All nullable: NULL means
    the run wasn't measured, never that it was free.

    The trade-plan fields (``entry_price`` through ``expected_value_r``) come
    from the trader stage rather than the final decision text — see
    backend/services/signals.py. They are the exit level and the quality of the
    bet, which the portfolio manager's own output doesn't carry. All nullable:
    NULL means "the model didn't state it", never zero, so a missing stop can
    never be read as a stop at $0.
