"""Posting to Discord, through a webhook.

**The app only ever posts.** It reads nothing and responds to nothing, and it
has had no commands since 2026-09-01. A webhook is therefore the whole
requirement: a URL copied from a channel's settings, and one HTTP POST.

What that replaced was a bot — an application, a token, OAuth scopes, an invite
URL, a gateway connection held open for the life of the process, and the
`discord.py` dependency threaded through startup and shutdown. All of it to
send a message.

**Set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` or leave it unset.** Unset disables notifications
and changes nothing else; the site and the agent behave identically.

A failed post is logged and swallowed. Discord being unreachable must never
stop the agent trading or the scheduler running — the notification is a copy of
what the database already holds, not the record itself.
