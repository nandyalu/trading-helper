"""One-off: delete every signal and everything derived from it, so the
scorecard can start fresh after a change of trade horizon.

Signals recorded under one horizon are evidence about a different question
than signals recorded under another. Mixing a 6-month thesis into a 1-2 week
scorecard makes both unreadable, so the switch to swing starts from empty.

This is deliberately a script and not an Alembic migration: a migration runs
on every deployment, and wiping the signal history on every deployment would
be a disaster. Run it once, by hand::

    python -m backend.scripts.reset_signals            # dry run, counts only
    python -m backend.scripts.reset_signals --yes      # actually delete

What it deletes, in foreign-key order (``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`` is set in
backend/database/engine.py, so the order is enforced, not just tidy):

1. ``papertransaction`` — references ``signal.id``
2. ``signalreport`` — references ``signal.id``
3. ``signal``
4. ``papersnapshot`` — no foreign key, but it is the valuation history of the
   paper trades deleted above; leaving it makes the equity curve start with a
   step change out of nowhere.

What it keeps: ``transaction`` (real, broker-synced holdings — actual money),
``watchlistticker``, ``botsetting``, and ``tickerprice`` (the price cache is
horizon-neutral and takes weeks to rebuild). ``alert`` is kept unless
``--include-alerts`` is passed; old alerts are stale but harmless.
