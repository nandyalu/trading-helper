"""The settings the experiment can change while it runs.

Every value here is a ``BotSetting`` row, so a change takes effect on the next
job without a redeploy. That matters for the record: flipping an environment
variable would change the model between one morning and the next, and the days
either side of the restart would look like one run.

What is *not* here is as deliberate as what is. There is no sync of a real
brokerage account, no sizing knob, and no way to trade. The agent sizes its own
positions and Python only refuses what cannot be executed as stated.
