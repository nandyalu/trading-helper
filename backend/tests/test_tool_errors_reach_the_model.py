"""A tool error is a message to the model, not the end of the analysis.

**This exists because of a measured loss.** The 14-way concurrency run on
2026-09-02 discarded two complete forty-minute analyses to a typo. The model
asked for an indicator called ``macd_histogram``; the real name is ``macdh``,
and the error said so, listing every valid name. It went to the logs instead of
to the model that could have acted on it.

Worse, the error counted as vendor ill-health. After three bad names yfinance's
circuit breaker opened, and for the next five minutes *every* indicator call
failed — including the correct ones.
