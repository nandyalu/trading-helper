# Credentials

Everything the app needs, and what happens when you skip each one.

**Only the Webull sandbox keys are required.** Without them the agent refuses to run, because it has no account to trade. Everything else degrades to something sensible.

| | Required? | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| [Webull sandbox](#webull) | **Yes** | The agent refuses to run |
| [Discord webhook](#discord) | No | No notifications. The site is identical |
| [FRED](#fred) | No | The news analyst infers rates from headlines, and says so in its own report |
| [Reddit](#reddit) | No | Sentiment comes from a public feed instead. This is the normal path |
| [An LLM](#the-model) | **Yes** | Nothing analyses anything |

## Webull

The agent's brokerage account, and real-time quotes.

1. Sign in at the [Webull OpenAPI developer portal](https://developer.webull.com/) with a normal Webull account.
2. Create an app. You get an **App Key** and an **App Secret**.
3. The portal issues sandbox and production credentials separately. **Take the sandbox pair.**

```
WEBULL_APP_KEY=...
WEBULL_APP_SECRET=...
WEBULL_SANDBOX=1
WEBULL_ACCOUNT_CLASS=INDIVIDUAL_CASH
```

**`WEBULL_SANDBOX=1` is not a suggestion.** The agent reads it itself and refuses every order without it. It is the boundary between an experiment and a machine spending real money, and it is checked in code rather than trusted to a config file.

`WEBULL_ACCOUNT_CLASS` picks which sandbox account to trade. `INDIVIDUAL_CASH` is the default and the right one: a cash account refuses a short outright. A margin account would fill one, which is why the app also enforces long-only itself rather than relying on the account type.

Quotes need a stock-quotes market-data subscription on the account. Without it, or after any failure, prices fall back to yfinance automatically.

## Discord

Notifications only. **A webhook, not a bot** — the app posts and never reads, so there is nothing to authenticate as.

1. In Discord, open the channel you want posts in.
2. **Edit Channel → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook.**
3. Name it, then **Copy Webhook URL**.

```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
```

That is the whole setup. No application, no token, no OAuth scopes, no invite link, and no bot in your member list.

Leave it unset and the app runs with no notifications at all. Nothing else changes — every post has a page on the site that holds the same information.

## FRED

Macro series: CPI, rates, the yield curve. [Free key from the St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html), issued immediately.

```
FRED_API_KEY=...
```

**Worth the two minutes.** Without it the news analyst infers the macro picture from headlines and says so in its own report — "Data Limitation: due to data access constraints". Reading the actual series is the point of having the analyst.

## Reddit

**Skip this.** Leave `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` and `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` unset and the sentiment analyst reads a public RSS feed, which needs no credentials and is the supported path.

**You probably cannot set it up anyway.** Reddit ended self-serve API app creation under its [Responsible Builder Policy](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/42728983564564-Responsible-Builder-Policy). New applications go through an approval aimed at products, not personal tools.

What you lose:

| | RSS (default) | OAuth |
|---|---|---|
| Credentials | None | Approval required |
| Rate limit | About 1 request a minute per IP | 100 a minute |
| Post score and comment count | No | Yes |

The rate limit is the only real difference, and the RSS path handles it: a `429` backs off once, honours `Retry-After`, then reports "no posts found" for that subreddit rather than failing the analysis. **`429` warnings in the log are expected, not a fault** — you will see a lot of them at high concurrency.

## The model

Either a local pool or a hosted API. Nothing else in the design cares which.

### A local Ollama pool

```
TRADINGAGENTS_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
TRADINGAGENTS_DEEP_THINK_LLM=gemma4-e4b-qat-128k
TRADINGAGENTS_QUICK_THINK_LLM=gemma4-e4b-qat-128k
TRADINGAGENTS_MAX_CONCURRENT_ANALYSES=1
```

Free beyond electricity, and slow — about 19 minutes an analysis on an 8 GiB card. **Set the concurrency to your GPU count and no higher**; see [Running it yourself](deploying.md#concurrency) for why more buys nothing.

### A hosted API

```
TRADINGAGENTS_LLM_PROVIDER=google
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
TRADINGAGENTS_DEEP_THINK_LLM=gemini-3.5-flash-lite
TRADINGAGENTS_QUICK_THINK_LLM=gemini-3.5-flash-lite
```

About 1.2 to 1.6 minutes an analysis, and roughly **$0.056 each** — near $10 a month for a nine-ticker daily sweep.

Both stages take the same value. The model is also a database setting, so the settings page changes it without a redeploy; these variables only supply the starting value.

**Choose on behaviour, not speed.** Five small models were rejected here for inventing prices they never fetched, and the fastest of them was the worst. See [Running it yourself](deploying.md#choosing-a-model-if-you-are-running-locally).

## Logs

The app writes to `data/logs/trading-experiment.log` on the same volume as the database, rotating at 5 MB across ten files — over a month at the volume this produces.

It writes to standard output too, so `docker logs trading-experiment` works. **The file exists because that output does not survive the container.** Rebuild the image and every line is gone.

That loss is not theoretical. Two positions were once found holding no exits, and the run that placed them had already been erased — so why the exits never rested had to be reconstructed from prices and ledger rows instead of read from the line the code had already written.

```bash
docker exec trading-experiment tail -f /app/data/logs/trading-experiment.log
docker exec trading-experiment grep INTC /app/data/logs/trading-experiment.log
```

Every logger is named `trading-experiment.<module>`, so grepping `trading-experiment.agent` gives the decision passes and nothing else.
